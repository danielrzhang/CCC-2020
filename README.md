# CCC-2020
This repository contains my written, original solutions/attempted solutions for the CCC (Canadian Computing Contest) 2020.

# Notes
 - This was the first CCC I wrote. I found it to be quite exciting and entertaining.
 - I wrote the Junior contest this year in Python 3 using the IDLE editor.
 - I finished the J1, J2, J3, and J4 in the first 45 minutes out of 3 total hours. One submission each :).
 - The Senior was really difficult this year. I could only manage the S1.
 - ~~WTF was J5/S2?!?!?!?!?!?!?!~~
